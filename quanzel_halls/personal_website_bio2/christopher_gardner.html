	<h2>Will Smith in "Pursuit of Happiness"</h2>
	<h4>Christopher Garnder, played by Will Smith, becomes a single-parent while struggling as a salesman. Christopher begins looking for secure employment to be able to provide the proper home and childhood he believes his son Christopher deserves.</h4>
	<h4>In this literal father-son movie, Christopher is played by Jaden Smith, Will Smith's actual son, which helps to protray an even closer bond of what a fathers love for his son looks like.</h4>
