	<h2> While pursuing an education in Industrial Technology at Buffalo State College, I am focused on learning new skills such as computer coding to expand my skill set. In addition to gaining my own knowledge to help branch out a future career in Engineering, I decided to return to Harlem Children's Zone, where I started off as a participant, and use my passion for the game of basketball to coach and develop youth skills from the ages of 8-18.  
	<br>
	<br>	
	<p>My strongest passion is for the game of basketball. I've been playing since the age of 4 and fell in love with it as soon as the ball touched my hands.</p>

	<p>Through my time with HBA Disrupt Harlem Code Squad, I hope to learn different coding languages that will help me to develop the necessary computer skills to one day create several businesses.
